    \section{\header{Project Management Guidelines}}
    \subsection{\header{Preamble}}

    Comprised throughout numerous well-known projects of the present era,
    \name{DVCS}\footnote{Distributed Version Control System.} is one of most comfortable branches of \name{VCS}\footnote{Version Control System.}s. \newline


    Because of its distributed bearing, the altering of the project is inexpensively feasible in the offline status. \newline
    This actuality stems from the fact that each individual is permitted to conduct his\textbackslash her own local copy of the project,
    and as labeled in the realm of \name{Version Control},
    \important{push} the developed \name{Revisions}\footnote{Also known as Commits.} to a central cloud repository
    once a satisfied condition of the project is prevailed.

    Thence, it is the default \name{VCS} which is utilized by the NexusWide organization in the field of project management. \newline

    This section elucidates all of the guidelines and practices which are employed throughout the organization
    in order to take full advantage of the \name{DVCS} capabilities.

     \section{\header{Designing Algorithm Guidelines}}
     \subsection{\header{Preamble}}

     Algorithms visualize the workflow of a computational process,
     they are the roadmap to the long-lasting periodic
     evolvment of a piece of computational mechanism,
     in this field, they are comparable to the base-foundational map of a tower engineering project,
     which easily demonstrates the importance of Algorithms for a engineering product. \newline

     Surprisingly,
     the importance of validating zero-vulnerability Algorithm conventions, is far beyond the topic of communications,
     as their existence fully rehabilitate the mediocrity of Red-Green refactor,
     in which the correct methodology for solving a problem,
     is found through exponential trial and error. \newline

     The concept of Red-Green refactor is suitable for side hustle projects,
     it is not suitable for adhering long-time processes, every failure costs time.

     Therefore the existence of high-quality Algorithms not only saves the time which is wasted on experimenting in order to find a solution,
     but also affects the overall quality of the product outcome.

     As every project follows the roadmap it is assigned to,
     then if the roadmap of the project is volatile,
     no outcome but failure is expected.


    \newpage
    \section{\header{Programming Guidelines}}
    \subsection{\header{Preamble}}


    Due to the modular form of a multifarious amount of programming languages,
    including \name{\LaTeX} and \name{Python}\footnotemark{}
    several people are enabled to work on the same application or feature concurrently,
    each with their own considerations and mentality. \newline

    in such circumstances, the absence of a comparable programming style would result in numerous time consuming conversations and courses,
    in order to apprehend the workflow of a codebase with differentiations at each of its sections. \newline

    This operation consumes the invaluable time which could be invested into effectively \important{reviewing} and \important{enhancing} the codebase,
    therefore results in insufficient outcomes. \newline


    The above-mentioned illustrations are the results of the lack of consistent regulations between the individuals
    thus they become even more prominent when a large number of entities are involved in a project
    and tasks are broken into countless fragments.
    \newline


    \footnotetext{Languages that are generally used in the NexusWide corporation for generating documentation files and automating tasks.}


    \newpage
    Fortunately,
    all of the aforementioned dilemmas can be prevented by decreasing the amount of creativity arrayed into
    the programming style of each person
    by developing a default guide for the populace in the organization to adhere,\newline
    so that amount of creativity can be directed into the actual development process of the working industry. \newline


    By endorsing this accuracy, we have conducted our own programming style guides with the aim of avoiding the referred considerations,
    which can be read at the following pages. \newline


    \newpage
    \subsection{\header{List of Rules}}


    \nexusrule{All programmers who use \name{Python}, MUST follow the \name{PEP8}\footnotemark{} style guide.} \newline

    \nexusrule{Programmers who use other languages, MUST follow their language style guide, but still adhere to the blank line rules of \name{PEP8}.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All source code documentations must follow the \name{Numpy} docstring formatting guidelines. } \newline

    \nexusrule{All codes MUST be reformatted by \name{PSF/Black}\footnotemark{} before being merged to the master ( \name{Main.Project}  ) branch.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All codes MUST have \important{at least} 80 percent of unit test coverage acceptance rate before being merged to the master ( \name{Main.Project} ) branch. } \newline

    \nexusrule{All unit test codes must have at \important{at least} 80 percent of mutation test acceptance rate before being merged to the master ( \name{Main.Project}  ) branch.} \newline

    \section{\header{File System Management Guidelines}}
    \subsection{\header{Preamble}}


    Since the dawn of technological computation, \name{resource management} have existed,
    and one of the most eminent subjects discussed in this field, is the persistent nature of the resources. \newline

    Fortunately, due to the existence of \name{peripheral memory systems}\footnotemark{} ( As instance \name{HDD}\footnotemark{}, \name{SSD}\footnotemark{}, ETC ) at the present epoch,
    we are not obliged to face the remnant flaw of grasping a solution for producing persistent file systems. \newline

    However, we are responsible for finding solutions for easing the process of navigating the file systems that we generate,
    therefore, we can either make finding items in a data storage a long-lasting and preferably bothering memory,
    or make it as suitable as possible for our own comfort. \newline

    The assurance of the fact that many individuals have faced filenames with labels alike ( test.something, popcorn ),

    and in rapidly worse scenarios, ( dont' touch this file ) is a completely acknowledged actuality. \newline

    Resources, files and directory tags are similar to names for a millennial,
    therefore they shall include the use case and the reason for their own existence. \newline

    \footnotetext[8]{Persistent and large storage memories.}
    \footnotetext[9]{Hard Disk Drive, a type of sequential access storage systems.}
    \footnotetext[10]{Solid State Drive, a branch of direct access storage systems.}


    \newpage
    Similar to humans which have incomparable preferences in naming their children,
    this state does again visualize itself while choosing tags for file system elements,
    and this acknowledgment may make navigating file systems made by other entities,
    a uncomfortable period of navigation. \newline

    We have decided to conduct a set of default morals for handling such situations,
    to evade the encountering annoying statuses, all of which can be read at the following pages.


    \newpage
    \subsection{\header{List of Rules}}


    \nexusrule{Only the \name{English} letter Characters [A-Z] and numbers [0-9] are allowed to be used in file names.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All file names MUST be in \name{snake\textunderscore case}: ( All letters MUST be in lowercase, instead of space underscore(\textunderscore ) is used ).} \newline

    \nexusrule{File names MUST start with a verb, and at the second part there MUST be a name or piece of information.} \newline

    \nexusrule{File names MUST be descriptive and self explanatory.} \newline

    one shared element have always been the same in the heart of every communication,
    and that is, \name{common understanding}. \newline

    This \name{common understanding} was obtained by numerous methodologies,
    including \name{shapes}, \name{languages}, \name{literature}, \name{typefaces}, \name{fonts} and currently, \name{markups}. \newline

    Just as a rich speaking language with a humble accent, can flow and direct the words and mentalities of a speaker comfortably,
    a apprehended set of \name{Markup tags} are capable of achieving the same results. \newline


    \newpage
    There is only one unsatisfactory acceptance that we have to make in order to acquire
    \name{common understanding}, and it is that both of the speakers and messengers, shall speak the same language. \newline

    And this rule also applies to our Brave New \name{Sillicon Valley} alike communications,
    indicating that if we do not speak the same language as each other,
    we would have to invest superior hours, explaining the foundation of our language. \newline

    The solution to this problem, is yet known,
    and it is that for all humans around the globe, to speak the same language. \newline
g
    In order to decrease the happening of communication degrades in our own organization,
    we have also produced rules and guidelines for our spoken language, \name{The Markdown Documentation Format},
    which can be read at the following pages. \newline


    \newpage
    \subsection{\header{List of Rules}}

    \nexusrule{Every markdown file MUST contain at least one header.} \newline

    \nexusrule{Headers should not be \textbf{bold}, \textit{italic}, ETC, they MUST be displayed in simple text.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All headers MUST be the highest priority header ( \# ), Usage of other headers is not allowed.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All \name{English} language sentence rules MUST be applied to headers\newline
    \example{Sentence MUST start with a uppercase letter}.} \newline
    \example{My name is John Doe.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All headers except for the table of content, MUST be a question sentence.} \newline

    \nexusrule{The header texts MUST be simple and descriptive, do not use complex words.} \newline

    \nexusrule{Every header MUST contain a text after ( inside ) answering the question that was asked in the header, which is acknowledged as subheader.} \newline


    \newpage
    \nexusrule{subheaders MUST answer the questions with a comprehensive and plain answer.} \newline

    \nexusrule{subheaders should never contain extra sentences other than the ones that are answering the question.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All subheader texts must come after a ruler line, which is inserted using the \name{-{}-{}-} command in \name{Markdown}. } \newline

    \nexusrule{All subheader texts must end a ruler line, which is inserted using the \name{-{}-{}-} command in \name{Markdown}. } \newline

    \nexusrule{All subheader text lines must start with the \name{>} formatting character.} \newline

    \section{\header{Information Organizing Guidelines}}
    \subsection{\header{Preamble}}


    We have annotated multifarious human preference related topics in the previous segments of the document,
    and have noted that to avoid disruption in the development process of a certain application,
    we \important{MUST} avoid interpolating our own preferences for labeling objects in the environment. \newline

    It is not only the label of the objects which is the matter of evaluation,
    but also their content,
    as it doesn't matter how meaningful the label of a \name{binary code}\footnotemark{} file is,
    the workflow of its content is yet unknown to a human being. \newline

    This matter also includes human-written text and raw \name{ASCII}\footnotemark{} files,
    as most of the time while reading and interpreting contents written by another person,
    due to their preference in the way of representing intelligence,
    they may be totally unreadable to us. \newline

    So we have injected the same fixture that we have included while discussing the clarity of labels in a file system,
    and that is, the preparation of a consistent and durable set of guidelines which can be read at the following pages.

    \subsection{\header{List of Rules}}


    \nexusrule{Each section of a text file should be partitioned using \name{title} texts.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All \name{title}s MUST be separated by two blank lines.} \newline

    \nexusrule{\name{title} names MUST be descriptive and simple, do not introduce redundant complexity.} \newline

    \nexusrule{Each \name{title} is allowed to contain numerous \name{subtitles}.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All \name{subtitle}s MUST be used only inside a \name{title}.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All first \name{subtitle}s inside MUST be separated from the \name{title} by one blank line.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All \name{subtitle}s MUST be one blank line separated from each other.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All \name{subtitle}s MUST have four indentation ( space character  ) levels before their main text.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All \name{subtitle}s MUST follow a incrementing numbering system.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All \name{subtitle} numbers MUST be in English.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All \name{subtitle}s MUST have a dot(.) after their numbering.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All \name{subtitle}s MUST have one space between their dot and the main text.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All \name{subtitle}s MUST end with a punctuation mark.} \newline

    \nexusrule{All of the text files MUST end with a -{}-{}-{}- END -{}-{}-{}- title tag.} \newline
